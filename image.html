<h3><font face="verdana" color="black">The difference between lossy and lossless compression on images</font></h3>
<p>Lossless compression takes the data from the original image and deletes the information which makes
<p>sthe whole process irreversable,As Lossless compression reduces the original size without loosing any data.</p>
<br>
<h3><font face="verdana" color="black">Why is it important for web designers to compress image files? </font></h3>
<p>Images are a major part in webpage content, and it is important for designers and web developers to
<p>control their image size and quality in order to deliver fast loading otherwise emailing files would take hours.</p> 

<h3><font face="verdana" color="black">The effects of lossy and lossless compression</font></h3>
<p>The obvious advantage to lossy compression is the reduced file size. Software allows you to choose the 
<p>degree of compression you wish to use, but the higher the ratio the more the image degrades.Lossless is 
<p>the reduced image that has no data loss. Lossless files retain the quality of your image as well as making
 <p>the file smaller with slight non noticable differences</p>
